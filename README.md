# Sweat Gymnasium Database Management System

This project was done as part of A level coursework in which a local gym needed a new system to manage all their clients and other needs. 

This project was written in python using the pyqt4 library and mysqlite3 library and thus has those dependencies. It was design to be compiled using the python compiler cx_freeze. A good tutorial on using this compiler can be found on [python school](pythonschool.net).
